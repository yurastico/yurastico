## Hi, my name is Yuri.

Recently, I made a decision: to post **everything** of code I write (outside of work, of course). I've always studied a lot in my spare time, but I was hesitant to share my projects. That's because many of my ideas probably came from courses, tutorials, or even projects I've seen around. I know that many people do this, posting a Twitter clone from some course, etc., but I've come to the conclusion that it's worth posting anything for a few reasons:

- To have a record of everything I do.
- To show people what I've been working on.
- To serve as a template for other projects.
- Nothing is created, everything is transformed (or copied, heh).
- To help anyone who needs a reference for something.

And here's some advice too: it took me a long time to reach this conclusion, sometimes by seeing this, you may reach it faster.

I will do my best to keep my GitHub organized, but I have a feeling that some "junk" will also end up there, haha.

Currently, I'm focusing on Mobile Development to understand how it works and perhaps create my own applications, but I'm currently using Java at work.
